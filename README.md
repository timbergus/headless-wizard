# Headless Wizard

An experiment to create a wizard with mobile cards.

The wizard contains a few cards that are piled on the center of the screen. The wizard is designed to fill the parent, so to see the effect of the cards being discarded on the side, we need to leave some padding around.

The cards need to be added as children **from the last one to the first one**.

You can also add a special card that will appear when all the cards has been used.
